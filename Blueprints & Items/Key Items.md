## Sealed Scroll
A sealed scroll from [[Tyrone]] giving me permission to use a glamor in the city. To be used as a last resort.

## Pendant (update name)
A pendant necklace that allows me to store one visual persona within it to be activated at will. Keeping the illusion requires concentration, though it will fool all but the most well trained eyes. To the casual observer, you are even able to touch the altered visage.
