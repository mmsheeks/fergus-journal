## Fergus and the Freaks

Or so they call us. Not my first choice of names, but the others seem amused enough by it. I can't figure why, it seems mildly demeaning? But so long as they're not offended I suppose.

We've got [[Aronia 'Ronni' Bloodthorn]], a dear friend of mine from my time in [[The Tyfiant Mire]]. She's an odd little one, but quite handy to keep around. Though, do watch your coin purse around her. quite sneaky.

[[Egg]] and [[Ss'tharak]] came to us as a pair, arriving just in time to help us defend the [[Carnrice Townfolk]] from the fires set by the [[Cliar Sgail]]. Egg is a cautious one, though I think for good reason. Quite skilled in leveraging his connection to Anima, though lacking in much formal training. Ss'tharak, meanwhile, is a capable fighter and seeks prey much more dangerous than any I've fought. He does seem somewhat put out by our travel thus far in the empire.

It's an odd crew, but we've settled in to something of a rhythm traveling together. And for better or worse, we've gotten into enough trouble that our fates are genuinely tied. I hope I've not gotten them in too much trouble, or stumbled too far into theirs to save myself.
