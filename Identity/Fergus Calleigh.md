Fergus Calleigh is a mid-rank research officer, currently missing in action, from the Imperial Military's Experimental Weapons Division. An acolyte of the Arcanum Revelarum from a young age, Fergus possessed a uniquely honed understanding of the intricacies of physical magic imbuement.

The research task he was set to work on for the Empire was to investigate the arcane properties of Tenebris, and refine a process for imbuing weapons with its power. At first, Fergus undertook this position for its lucrative funding budget and relatively unobtainable goal. Seeing an opportunity to pursue his own interests at the expense of the Imperial budget. Along the way however, he developed a fascination with the curiosities of Tenebral magic, and ended up achieving the empire's goals.

By the time Fergus had successfully decoded enough of the Tenebral to imbue weapons as he had been ordered, he had become disenchanted with the notion of what Empire might do with such a magical technology. So, instead of giving his research over to the military, he took the only notes that mattered with him and left without a trace.
