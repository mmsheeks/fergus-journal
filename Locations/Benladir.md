A large city built into the stony cliffs of a tall mountain.

The lower city, full of working class and merchant traders, sits low in the mountain. Above it, connected by a winding path, is Upper Benladir, home of the government, most temples, and the ruling class.

This is where Fergus made his home, before he fled the empire.

## Updates
Upon my return, we've found the guard tripled. The new guards seem heavily upgraded in their equipment, and there's talk of recent attacks. (these may be related to the draconic mess we've been dealing with).
