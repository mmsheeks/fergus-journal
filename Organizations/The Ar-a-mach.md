While the Ar-a-mach (Monarad for Rebellion) are technically also a criminal organization, they've got a much mor favorable reputation than the Cliar Sgail. Both emerged from people not wanting to live under Empire occupation, but the Cliar Sgail did so in aggressive ways, and has since fully lost their original goal. the Ar-a-mach however, keep being a thorn in the empire's side from the shadows, but don't kill or harm innocents.
