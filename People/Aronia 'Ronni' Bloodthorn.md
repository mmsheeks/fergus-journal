Rogue

Ronni is a fae like creature that has been living in town with Fergus for a short while. She takes the form of a humanoid plant-like being, with a bush full of berries on top of her head.

Ronni wants to be good, mostly, but is primarily driven by curiosity and will eat pretty much anything once.
