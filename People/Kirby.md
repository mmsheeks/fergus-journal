Friend from bootcamp, stayed close through most of Fergus's service after having bonded during a rough set of training sessions around combat magic. Not terribly skilled at casting, but highly skilled at designing and crafting. Fergus drew away as his research turned to darker things, didn't tell Kirby anything before he left but it would have been apparent he was avoiding the topic of his work.

## Updates
Upon returning from my time in hiding, I've found Kirby arrested. It's unclear what for, but he seems to have run afoul of the empire in some way.
