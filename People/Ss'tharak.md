Monk

Ss'tharak is a large lizard-man native to the swamps of [[The Tyfiant Mire]]. He carries a blue dragon scale tipped spear, and follows the ways of the monk.

Ss'tharak carries some serious trauma from what seems to have been a dragon attack on his home some years ago. He also tends to eat dead humans, sometimes ritualistically.
